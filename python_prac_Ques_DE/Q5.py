Basic String Manipulation
Write a function called greet that takes two arguments: name (a string) and age (an integer).
 The function should return a string message in the format "Hello, [name]! You are [age] years old."
'''
def greet(name: str, age: int) -> str:
    # Do something here
    return f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."# here you should return the final string "Hello, [name]! You are [age] years old."
